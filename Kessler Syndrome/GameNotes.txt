Interface Ideas 3/1/2022:
2 Rectangular bars in bottom left
1 is health
1 is fuel

top right has measure of gravity on each planet
top left has some kind of indication of progress - like a graphic showing position on planet or a timeline
bottom right has item collection? - depending on number of items in game, may have an icon representing like a bag, or just 
an icon for each item if there are only like 3 things we are collecting
